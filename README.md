network-program-learning
========================

Well, this is a repo to place the learning code for network program in c++. 

I start this to learn the sockets and network relate program stuff under the linux. 
Most of the codes and homework I write is come from the Beej's Guide to Network Programming.
But consider the C++ elements, I will refactor the c code from the book to the c++ with Boost library.

Eventually, a irc client  Rot is the Finally project.
